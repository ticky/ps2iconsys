** PS2 IconSys ReadMe    **
*-------------------V-1.0-*


*** What is it? ***
The PS2 IconSys are a number of tools that allow the
creation and manipulation of Icons and Icon.sys files
for Sony Playstation 2 Memory Cards.
They can be used either as command line tools for the
system shell or as libraries for C++ development.


*** How does it work ***
The PS2 browser expects at least two file in each
subdirectory of a memory card. First, a file named
icon.sys which contains basic information about the
data in that directory, like the description string
displayed in the browser, as well as the name of at
least one Icon file in that directory. This Icon will
then be displayed in the browser. If either of these
two files is missing, the browser will display the
directory as a blue box labeled "corrupted data".
With the enclosed tools, one can easily create both
icon.sys and Icon files that are needed for proper
browser display.


*** Installation ***
For detailed compilation instructions, refer to the
COMPILE document in the sources archive.


*** Contents ***
As of the current version, the PS2 IconSys toolset
consists of three command line tools:
 * build_iconsys - Allows the creation and manipulation
    of Icon.sys files. Those files act as content
    descriptors for the Playstation 2 internal browser
    and must be present in each subdirectory of a PS2
    memory card.
 * obj_to_ps2icon - Allows the conversion of a PS2 Icon
    into a Wavefront OBJ file for model geometry, and
    TGA file for 2d texture data.
 * ps2icon_to_obj - Allows to create PS2 Icons of arbitrary
    geometry from Wavefront OBJ files and TGA/BMP texture
    files.

A detailed description for each of the tools can be viewed
by calling the respective tool with the -h parameter.


*** FAQ & Known Issues ***
 * What is Wavefront OBJ?
  - Wavefront OBJ is a well known human-readable format for
    3d graphics interchange. It is known by most
    3d-applications out there, including 3ds max
    and Blender.

 * I noticed that the converted OBJ files have lots of
   doubled vertices. Is that intentional?
  - This issue comes from the fact of how PS2 Icons store
    their geometry. It should however not provide any
    problem and can easily be fixed with a 3d editor
    of your choice.

 * When I open a converted OBJ in a 3d editor the model
   has some holes in it.
  - Some 3d editors tend to flip faces of imported
    OBJ-meshes for no apparent reason. This can usually
    be fixed inside the 3d application with no greater
    effort. Consult the manual of your 3d application
    for further details.

 * The parameter list of the build_iconsys tool makes my
   head feel funny.
  - If you'd prefer a GUI, look for MC_ICON.SYS_Generator
    at http://ps2dev.org/ps2/Tools
    If I get bored, I might add Lua scripting support in
    a future version to get rid of the lengthy parameter
    lists.

 * What about animated Icons?
  - In a future version. If you're really impatient, feel
    free to play around with the source, it should contain
    everything you need.
 
 * The PS2 doesn't read my Icon!
  - This is probably due to the polygon limit. Try keeping
    your mesh under 1500 triangles to ensure compatibility.
